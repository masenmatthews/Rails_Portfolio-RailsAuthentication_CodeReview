# Masen's Portfolio

#### _A Rails application designed to hold the contents of my professional portfolio._, {April 27, 2018}_

### By Masen Matthews

## Description
  This site is designed to act as my personal portfolio so that I can showcase my coding skills and projects to potential employers. It will have spaces for projects, blog posts, contact information, and an 'about me' section.

## The Big Picture
  Last April, I had no real ambitions or aspirations related to tech or web development. Learning to code has always been something that's sat in the back of my mind as something I would like to do if I had an infinite amount of free time, ambition, motivation, or a combination of those things. At that time, I was a few weeks away from finishing college with a degree in sociology and a strong desire to continue on to law school in hopes of being service-oriented defense attorney with a strong passion to help those who needed assistance the most.

  Long story short, a lot of things have changed in the past year. I graduated from college and moved out of my spacious, cheap apartment in Northern Idaho into a house in Portland with a bunch of people that I didn't know. Shortly after that, I got a job at a law firm and came to the quick realization that the career path would probably make me miserable. If it didn't, the crippling student debt that came along with getting a J.D. would. After a handful of conversations at various Meetups, I decided to give coding a shot and enrolled at Epicodus a few short weeks before classes started.

  At this point, it may seem like I decided to attend code school and embark on this journey on an impulsive whim. This is true, but being in your early 20's is nice because it allows you to make these kinds of impulsive decisions. The tuition wasn't too expensive, I didn't have a great job that I was leaving, and I didn't have a family or relationship to support. I knew I might hate coding, but at least I'd be learning and that's a lot better than getting screamed at through a phone and spending my days putting away files in a sterile, lifeless office.

  Luckily, I've come to find that I really do enjoy coding. In a lot of ways, it acts as an avenue that combines pieces of different things that I greatly enjoy in a unique way. There's a creative aspect, which is appealing to me as a long-time guitarist and someone with a background in radio. There's a logic-driven component, which would've been a key part of being an attorney. Beyond that, I get the satisfaction of organizing and designing blocks of code and design elements. Perhaps most importantly, I can listen to music and/or public radio while I code all day and that's really awesome. It's the little things that count the most.

## Motivation
  The central motivation behind this project is to create a portfolio that adequately showcases some of the projects that I've completed during my time at Epicodus. It is also designed to survive past my time in code school, which means that it will be continually updated with new projects, updates, blog posts, and so on. Put simply,I want to jump into the world of tech on a professional level and this site will be used to demonstrate my qualifications and learning progressions.
